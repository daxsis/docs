This guide aims to enable users to install Fprime directly on their Windows environment without the use of VirtualBox.

This article is a stub. Help out by contributing through Github. Use a virtualization product like VirtualBox and an Ubuntu Bionic-based (Ubuntu 18.04, Mint Linux 19.3) OS image as an alternative for now.
