# Fprime Guide

_Note: This guide is a conglomerate of different guides provided in the [Fprime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) repo. At the bottom of this page, there is a list of resources the user might find useful when working with Fprime._

The following guide will cover the installation, deployment and capabalities of Fprime. Fprime is a component-driven framework tailored to small-scale spaceflight systems such as CubeSats. This framework was created by NASA and allows for rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications.
